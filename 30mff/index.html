        <h1><b>Running Late: Every Second Counts</b></h1>
        <p>In the bustling city of Abu Dhabi, where every second counts, we follow the daily struggles of Max, a college student notorious for his perpetual battle with punctuality. As dawn breaks over the city skyline, Max's alarm clock springs to life, but it's no match for his stubborn snooze button habit.</p>
        <p>With each press of the snooze button, Max's morning routine spirals further into chaos. He races against the clock to get ready, but his efforts are constantly thwarted by a series of mishaps: spilled coffee, missing keys, and a wardrobe malfunction that leaves him wearing mismatched socks.</p>
        <p>As Max rushes out the door, his backpack still lies forgotten on his couch. He navigates through crowded and maze-like corridors, but every delay seems to conspire against him. A few wrong turns, and unexpected detours further compound his woes.</p>
        <p>Desperate and disheveled, Max finally arrives, only to find himself sitting inside the wrong classroom. With each passing minute, his anxiety mounts as he frantically searches for the correct lecture hall, dodging puzzled stares from classmates and professors alike.</p>
        <p>Just when it seems like all hope is lost, Max's perseverance pays off as he stumbles upon the right classroom, breathless and bedraggled. As he walks in, he can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all, realizing that despite the chaos, he's made it just in time.</p>
