Project Name
30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF) Website
Project Description
The 30MFF Website serves as my introductory project to web development and design, providing an online platform for the 30 Minute Film Festival. This festival celebrates short films crafted within a succinct 90-second timeframe, with a focus on storytelling brevity, creativity, and impactful narratives. The website aims to immerse visitors in the world of short-form cinema through concise descriptions, captivating visuals, and interactive elements
Process
1. Conceptualization: Opting for a one-page design to ensure simplicity, I outlined the key elements of the website, including its structure, content, and design aesthetics. We defined the festival's concept, theme, and the overall experience I wanted to create for visitors.
2. Content Creation: Curating engaging content, such as film descriptions, credits, promotional images, and a brief festival overview, was crucial. The goal was to provide visitors with comprehensive information while sparking curiosity and interest in exploring the featured films.
3. Design and Development: Experimenting with different fonts, colors, and layouts, I implemented the one-page design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on creating a visually appealing layout with intuitive navigation, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
4. Testing and Optimization: Thorough testing identified and resolved any bugs, errors, or compatibility issues. I optimized the website's performance, including loading times and responsiveness, to provide a smooth and enjoyable browsing experience.
5. Deployment: Once the website was finalized and tested, I deployed it to a hosting platform, making it accessible to the public. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure the website's functionality and performance over time.
Reflection/Evaluation
Being my introduction to web development and design, the 30MFF Website project provided invaluable learning experiences and insights into the process of creating a functional and visually appealing website. While the final product differed slightly from the initial wireframe, the implementation of the concept, theme, and interactive elements effectively communicated the festival's essence. However, in retrospect, including some behind-the-scenes images would have enriched the website's content and provided visitors with a deeper insight into the filmmaking process. Moving forward, I am excited to continue honing my skills and exploring new opportunities in the field of web development and design.
