### Process

**Planning and Design:**
The initial stage involved brainstorming sessions to define the site structure and content strategy. Sketches and wireframes were created using Adobe XD to visualize the layout and user journey. The design choices, including a dark theme with vibrant accent colors, reflect the energetic and dynamic nature of music production.

**Development:**
The development phase was segmented into frontend and backend tasks. The p5.js drum pad was meticulously coded to replicate the feel of an actual drum machine, with each pad triggering different drum sounds. Challenges in synchronizing audio playback were resolved by optimizing the JavaScript code and ensuring efficient sound file loading.

**Testing and Optimization:**
The site underwent rigorous testing, including user testing with peers to gather feedback on the drum pad's functionality and overall site usability. Performance optimizations were carried out, focusing on loading times and interactive responsiveness.

**Launch:**
The website was launched after several iterations of testing and feedback. It is hosted on a reliable platform to handle varying traffic loads, with continuous monitoring set up to ensure uptime and performance.
